it is a distributed system(multiple servers/machines) which maintain 2 qualities out of three
1. c = consistancy  : every user get same data 
2. a = availability : response to every request if there is old data or system is slow
3. p = partition tolerence : if there is network fail in between server , then system should do some work

Theorem rule :
you only can acces 2 out of 3
c+p = banking system(data should not be wrong)
a+p = whatsapp(message go instantly, if update is late)
c+a = practically impossible in network failure

*real life example
System	                                  Category (Approx)	                            Explanation
MongoDB	                                        CP	                      Writes are consistent, but may become unavailable
Cassandra	                                      AP	                      Always available, but might give stale data
RDBMS (MySQL)	                             CA (non-distributed)	          Good consistency and availability if no partition
