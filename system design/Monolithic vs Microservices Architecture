Monolithic:
we add all feature in 1 codebase - login, cart, order, payment all are packed compactly
example :
making a mobile app
in app.py you add all - login, signup, order, search 
if there is bug in any of them , then whole system will be affected
 Pros: development esy,testing fast,deployment easy(1 file upload)
 cons: difficult to scale, 1 bug full feature crash, large codebase is difficult to handle,hard to check tech stack(all written in one language)

Microservices Architecture:
break the system into small small independent services , every service has its own  database,  code, deployment.
example:
Flipkart

Login → one microservice

Search → another

Cart → another

Payment → another
if bug in payment system other will work properly

pros:
Easily scalable 

Fast deployment 

Failures isolated 

Tech stack flexible 

cons:
Development complex 

Data consistency tough 

Network calls more

Deployment & monitoring more difficult
