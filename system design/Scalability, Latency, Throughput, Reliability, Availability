**scalabiliy - to make the system big and more powerful
to make the system more enhance to handle more users and traffic.
types : 
1 vertical scaling (scale-up) : make one server more powerful and give more functions and feature to it 
example: increase RAM , CPU
2. horizontal scaling (scale-out) : deploying more server

**latency - time taken by respinse time
client send reques - reply by server = time gap between this => Latency
example: if we search anything in google , suppose it response result in 2 second the letancy=2
fast system = low latency

**throughput : how much work done by system in 1 second
-how much request per seconds(RPS) and order per minute are handled
example: flipkart manage 1000 order per second , throughput=1000ops/sec
more throughput = powerful system

**availability
how much time system works - 24/7 available or down again & again
Example:
99% availability = every 100 minute there is 1 minute system down
99.99% availability = every 10,000 minutes there is 1 minute system down
downtime low and uptime more == high availability

** Reliability 
system should give same output if same input is repeated , without any error or crash
if we give 1 order 10 times then successfully we get output 

**consistency - every user see same data
when user uploads photo --- another person see same photo
example: 
when i send some message on whatsapp and then i delete that message --- all peopke mobile should be sync
