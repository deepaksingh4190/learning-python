System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specific requirements. It's essentially creating a blueprint for a system, whether it's software, hardware, or a combination of both, that outlines how it will be built and how its parts will interact. 
Key Aspects of System Design:
Requirements Gathering:
Understanding the needs and goals of the system is crucial. This involves identifying both functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (like performance, scalability, security, etc.). 
Architecture:
This defines the overall structure of the system, including the major components and how they are interconnected. Common architectures include monolithic, client-server, microservices, and service-oriented architectures. 
Components and Modules:
Breaking down the system into smaller, manageable parts (components) and further dividing them into modules (sub-components). 
Interfaces:
Defining how different components and modules will interact with each other, specifying the data formats and protocols used for communication. 
Data Design:
Determining how data will be stored, accessed, and managed within the system. 
Scalability, Availability, Reliability, and Performance:
These are crucial non-functional requirements that need to be considered during the design phase. They ensure the system can handle increasing load, remain operational even with failures, and perform efficiently. 

Why is System Design Important?
Provides a blueprint: It helps in building a well-organized and efficient system. 
Facilitates communication: A clear design document ensures everyone involved understands the system's structure and functionality. 
Enables efficient development: By defining the components and interfaces, it streamlines the development process. 
Improves maintainability and scalability: A well-designed system is easier to maintain, modify, and scale as needed. 
Reduces risks: It helps identify potential issues early on, minimizing the risk of costly mistakes during implementation.
